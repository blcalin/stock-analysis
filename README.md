# Stock Written Analysis using VBA


## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor VBA code for 2017 and 2018, in order to analyze the likelihood of reinvesting in a select number or listing of stocks. Data provided was an inefficient method of sorting through stocks, and refactoring was necessary in order to quickly find a solution.

### Data
Data presented includes two charts of 12 stock tickers, with the goal of determining ticker, daily volume and return. Information provided includes ticker, issue date, opening, closing, highest, lowest, and adjusted stock prices, and volume of stock.

## Results and Analysis
Two charts for years 2017 and 2018 were created, color coded based on return (green for positive, red for negative using the vbcolor formula). Using starter code, an input box, headers, and arrays (for ticker volume, starting price, ending price) were created in order to refactor our code to find ticker, volume and return information. The charts below are examples of the 2017 and 2018 output based on our expected analyses.

## Summary
### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code
Refactoring code ensures it is more visible and easier to read for the viewer. This can lead to faster processing time, overall process improvement, and organization of both code and the individual producing it for more succinct data. When refactoring code, disadvantages include technological limitations such as storage space, and not having the appropriate amount of data in order to solve the problem at hand.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactored Script
Advatanges of refactored stock data include processing time. The original script would involve manually sorting through stock data, whereas refactoring allows us to process 2017 and 2018 stocks in 0.16 seconds respectively, per the screenshots below.

Overall, the use of VBA and refactoring is particularly helpful when working with a larger data set. This allows us to efficiently and effectively sort through large quantities of data, which saves time and resources.
